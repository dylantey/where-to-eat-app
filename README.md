## About
Android application project for the Fall 2018 University of Minnesota course:
<i>CSCI 5115: User Interface Design, Implementation and Evaluation.</i>

Currently a mock application to showcase the user interface of a voting app. This will contain several features, such as:
- A local sign-in screen.
- A local account page.
- A lobby system for communication between devices.
- Local database access, for hard-coded restaurant information.
- Synchronous voting between devices.

Functionally, the appplication is designed to work as a means of filtering restaurants based on user criteria, then voting on a place to eat using two or more devices.

Research has been made to narrow down our design choices to create an application that will hopefully be intuitive, reactive, and complete.
